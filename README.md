# Flight Delay Prediction

Flight delays in the United States were predicted using the dataset provided by the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/glossary.asp). Different ML techniques such as NNs and Ridge/Lasso Regression were implemented before choosing the best model.

- In the beginning, we peform data pre-processing and feature selection in Pandas

- Next, we input the processed data into our models - Regression and Neural Networks (NN)

- For regression, different techniques (Ridge/Lasso) were employed

- Requirements: Pytorch, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
